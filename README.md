# Home Monitoring System for Bipolar Disorder and Depression

## Overview

Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a significant mental health condition characterized by alternating manic and depressive periods. During manic or hypomanic stages, individuals may experience euphoria, increased energy, rapid speech, and risky behaviors. In depressive periods, they often feel numb to positive experiences and struggle with feelings of worthlessness and isolation.

Depression, another serious mood disorder, manifests in various forms but consistently involves loss of interest, a persistently low mood, pessimism, changes in appetite, and sleep disturbances. These conditions not only reduce the quality of life but also increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are a leading cause of death among those with serious mental health issues.

## Project Aim

This project aims to develop a comprehensive home monitoring system specifically designed for patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and/or depression. Our platform will enhance the management of these conditions through:

- **Patient-Healthcare Provider Communication**: Facilitate seamless communication between patients and their healthcare providers.
- **Health Data Tracking**: Allow patients to upload and share health data, such as sleep quality, heart rate, and blood pressure, enabling better monitoring and personalized treatment.
- **Appointment Management**: Provide tools for managing appointments with healthcare professionals.
- **Early Detection of CVDs**: Enable early identification of cardiovascular issues, allowing for prompt intervention and prevention.

## Key Components

Our project encompasses several critical aspects:

- **Dataset Design and Management**: We have designed and implemented a comprehensive dataset schema to capture and manage patient health data effectively. This includes:
  - **Database Design**: Creating the structure for storing various types of patient data.
  - **Data Filling**: Populating the database with initial data to support testing and development.

- **User Interface Development**: We have developed intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for different user roles, including:
  - **Patient Interface**: For managing personal health data, appointments, and interactions with healthcare providers.
  - **Specialized Practitioner Interface**: For managing patient interactions and appointments.
  - **Technical Administrator Interface**: For overseeing system operations, managing users, and performing backups.

## Features

- **Regular Health Data Updates**: Patients can regularly upload their health metrics for ongoing assessment.
- **Customized Treatment Plans**: The system supports the creation of personalized treatment plans based on detailed health data.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of key parameters to improve diagnostic accuracy and care.
- **In-Hospital and Home Data Collection**: Support for both in-hospital and home-based health monitoring.

## Benefits

- **Improved Treatment Outcomes**: Better follow-up and tailored treatment plans lead to enhanced therapeutic outcomes.
- **Early CVD Detection**: Rapid identification and intervention for cardiovascular diseases, improving overall health.
- **Streamlined Patient Experience**: Easier management of appointments and health data, leading to a more efficient and supportive treatment journey.
